# My Art Portfolio Website

This is a website made to showcase the different art-related projects I made over the years. The purpose of this website is to provide myself with a better way to showcase my own works in a simple manner and in a way that would be easy to update frequently.
It mainly focuses on my digital art but will also showcase other projects related to things like video-editing, video game development, graphic design, etc. This website is similar to my other [website](https://github.com/tony-tomass/tony-tomass.github.io) 
project created several months prior for my web development class. Unlike that one, this website will be worked on during my own personal time with more emphasis on professionalism.
